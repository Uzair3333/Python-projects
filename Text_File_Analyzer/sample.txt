The Text File Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to extract
and summarize essential statistics from any .txt file.
It performs a comprehensive analysis by counting the total number of lines, words,
and characters, and also generates a frequency report of each word in the file.
This project emphasizes core Python skills such as file handling, string manipulation,
dictionaries, and basic error handling.
