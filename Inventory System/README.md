# 🧾 Inventory Management System (CSV-Based)

This is a simple yet practical Python program to manage product inventory using the **CSV** module.  
You can view, add, search, and calculate total stock value — all from the terminal!  

It’s a great hands-on project for anyone learning **file handling**, **data validation**, and **CSV operations** in Python.
